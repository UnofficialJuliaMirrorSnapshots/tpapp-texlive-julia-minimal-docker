# What

Scripts for building, testing, and deploying the image, on the local machine of Tam√°s.

# Why

**NOT NEEDED** in general, as CI will test and push the image (from `master`) once it passes. Using PRs is the preferred solution for testing and development, *this is a fallback*.

# How

Run from the parent directory, eg

```sh
local/build-locally.sh
```
